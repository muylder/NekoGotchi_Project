 * @brief ðŸ“± BLE Spam/Denial-of-Service Attack Framework
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-10-26
 * 
 * @details Implements various BLE advertisement spam attacks targeting
 * device discovery mechanisms on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms.
 * Uses NimBLE stack for efficient multi-attack broadcasting.
 * 
 * **Attack Types:**
 * - Sour Apple: Fake Apple device advertisements (AirPods, AirTag, HomePod)
 * - Samsung Spam: Galaxy Watch/Buds pairing popups (25+ device models)
 * - Google Fast Pair: Android device pairing spam
 * - Microsoft Swift Pair: Windows 10/11 pairing spam
 * - Spam All: Rotate through all attack types
 * 
 * **Features:**
 * - Random MAC address generation per packet
 * - Adjustable send interval (default: 100ms)
 * - Packet counter for statistics
 * - Non-blocking execution mode
 * - 10 Apple device types, 25 Samsung models
 * 
 * **Educational Purpose:** This code is for security research and testing only.
 * Unauthorized BLE spam may violate regulations (FCC Part 15, CE, etc.).
 * 
 * @warning Use responsibly in controlled environments only!

 * ```cpp
 * BluetoothAttacks ble;
 * ble.begin();
 * ble.startSourApple();
 * while (ble.isRunning()) {
 *     ble.executeSourApple();
 *     delay(100);
 * }
 * ble.stop();
 * ```

 * **Architecture:**
 * - Uses NimBLEAdvertising for efficient packet transmission
 * - Random MAC address per packet prevents filtering
 * - Payload generators for each platform (Apple/Samsung/Google/Microsoft)
 * - Non-blocking execution via execute*() methods
 * 
 * **Performance:**
 * - Default send interval: 100ms (10 packets/sec)
 * - Adjustable via _sendInterval member
 * - Packet counter for monitoring effectiveness
 * 
 * @warning High packet rates may cause device instability or network congestion
